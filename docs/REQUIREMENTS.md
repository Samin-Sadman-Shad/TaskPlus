Software Engineer || .NET Full Stack
Assignment Overview
Build a Smart Task Management System that demonstrates your ability to develop a
modern, secure, and maintainable full-stack application using ASP.NET Core 9 or 10 and
Angular.
The focus of this assignment is on code quality, security, maintainability, and best
practices, rather than simply implementing CRUD operations.
Objectives
Your solution should demonstrate your ability to:
• Build a clean and scalable application
• Develop secure REST APIs
• Create a responsive Angular frontend
• Follow SOLID principles
• Apply design patterns where appropriate
• Document your solution clearly
• Integrate a simple AI-powered feature

• Build Angular Frontend
• Complete Documentation
Deliverables
Submit:
• Complete Source Code managed in a GitHub repository
• GitHub repository link shared with the submission
• SQL Database Script or EF Core Migrations
• README.md
• PROMPTS.md
• API Collection (Postman or Swagger Export)
Final Goal
Deliver a production-ready Smart Task Management System that demonstrates strong
software engineering skills, secure API development, modern Angular development, and
clear documentation.
Good engineering practices, maintainability, and code quality are more important
than implementing every possible feature.```
